# ONBOARDING.md

This file is a prompt and onboarding guide for any AI agent joining the Snake Math Vue project. It outlines how the agent should familiarize itself with the project’s structure, rules, and responsibilities.

---

## Start Here

Begin by reading the main instruction file located at:

```plaintext
CLAUDE.md
```

This file lives in the **project root** and contains:

- An overview of the instruction system
- Links to all subordinate guidance documents
- The standard workflow for all agents

All other instruction files are located in the `instructions/` folder.

---

## Instruction File System Overview

Each instruction file in `instructions/` has a specific purpose:

- `HANDOFF.md` – Project architecture and current implementation state
- `TASKLIST.md` – Active and upcoming tasks
- `TASKLOG.md` – Log of completed actions and decisions
- `DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md` – UI/UX, component, and layout standards
- `SYSTEM-MEMORY.md` – Persistent project truths and architectural decisions
- `AGENT-CONDUCT.md` – Agent behavior rules and delegation logic
- `IDEAS.md` – Deferred ideas, experimental features
- `CONTENT.md` – Map of current and planned educational content

---

## Your Responsibilities

Once you have read `CLAUDE.md`, begin operating according to its workflow:

1. Consult `TASKLIST.md` and `HANDOFF.md` for current priorities
2. Validate decisions using `SYSTEM-MEMORY.md` and `DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md`
3. Act in accordance with `AGENT-CONDUCT.md`
4. When completing a task or making a change:
   - Update `TASKLOG.md` with your action and rationale
   - Add future work to `TASKLIST.md` if needed
   - Record persistent facts in `SYSTEM-MEMORY.md`
   - Use `IDEAS.md` for any conceptual proposals or out-of-scope ideas
   - Use `CONTENT.md` to reflect new or changed components, topics, or content

---

## Objective

Ensure that any AI agent—now or in the future—can:

```markdown
Be pointed to CLAUDE.md
→ Read referenced instruction files
→ Begin contributing safely and correctly
```

You must preserve this self-sufficiency by:

- Keeping file references accurate
- Avoiding external assumptions
- Logging all meaningful actions

---

## Next Step

Once you have familiarized yourself with the structure, begin reviewing and updating the following:

```
CLAUDE.md → instructions/TASKLIST.md → instructions/CONTENT.md
```

---

**Your memory is structured. Your mission is live.**
