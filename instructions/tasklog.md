10. **Project Cleanup** - Removed unused files and moved to .archive
    - Moved to `.archive/`: HelloWorld.vue, TheWelcome.vue, WelcomeItem.vue
    - Moved to `.archive/`: icons/ folder (IconCommunity.vue, IconDocumentation.vue, etc.)
    - Moved to `.archive/`: logo.svg, base.css, main.css (unused assets)
    - Moved to `.archive/`: TopicSidebar.vue (replaced by TopicNavigation.vue)
    - Build verification: Successful build after cleanup (340KB JS, 72KB CSS)
    - Result: Cleaner project structure with only actively used components

11. **Documentation Updates** - Updated all project documentation
    - File: `instructions/project-blueprint.md`

    - File: `instructions/project-outline.md`
    - Updates: Progressive Web App vision, responsive design, implementation phases
    - File: `CLAUDE.md`
    - Updates: File organization with .archive and styles structure

12. **FontAwesome Integration** - Added professional icon system
    - Installed: `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` package
    - Updated: `src/assets/styles/main.css` to import FontAwesome CSS
    - Replaced emoji icons with FontAwesome classes in topic navigation
    - Topics now use: fa-book, fa-calculator, fa-chart-bar, fa-drafting-compass, fa-vector-square, fa-infinity
    - Mobile toggle icons: fa-bars and fa-times replace hamburger and X emojis
    - Modified: `src/components/common/TopicNavigation.vue` to use `<i>` tags with class binding

13. **Snake Favicon Creation** - Custom favicon with snake design

14. **Header Responsive Redesign** - Unified single-layer header layout
    - Problem: Header appeared as 2-3 separate layers (title row, navigation row, mobile menu)
    - Solution: Redesigned using CSS Grid with three areas: left (title), center (navigation), right (theme switcher)
    - Desktop: Grid layout with navigation centered between title and controls
    - Mobile: Two-row grid with title/controls on top, navigation below (all within same container)
    - Updated: `src/App.vue` header structure and CSS Grid responsive layout
    - Updated: `src/components/common/TopicNavigation.vue` removed separate borders/backgrounds
    - Result: Cohesive single-layer header appearance across all screen sizes
    - Build verification: Successful build with improved responsive design

15. **Bootstrap Integration & Style Centralization** - Professional design system

    - Fixed: Updated Bootstrap theme system to use proper `data-bs-theme` attribute instead of custom CSS variables
    - Modified: `src/assets/styles/bootstrap-custom.scss` to include proper dark theme overrides for `.bg-light` class
    - Updated: `src/components/common/ThemeSwitcher.vue` to set `data-bs-theme="dark"` on document root
    - Refactored: `src/App.vue` to remove conflicting custom CSS and rely on Bootstrap utility classes
    - Resolved: SCSS deprecation warnings are expected from Bootstrap 5.x and can be safely ignored
    - Build verification: Successful build with dark theme header properly styled (374KB CSS)
    - Result: Proper Bootstrap theme system with working dark mode including header background
