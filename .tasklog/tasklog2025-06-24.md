- **Goal**: Educational math platform with interactive visualizations

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Project Analysis & Planning
**Time**: Start of session  
**Action**: Analyzed codebase and created comprehensive project documentation  
**Details**: 
- Read existing Vue 3 project structure (basic scaffolding)
- Analyzed old VitePress project documentation (vue-project-handoff.md, old-project-blueprint.md, old-project-outline.md)
- Identified scope: 6 mathematical domains, 19+ interactive components, educational focus

### 2. Core Infrastructure Setup
**Time**: Early session  
**Action**: Established foundational project structure  
**Details**:
- ‚úÖ Installed dependencies: `katex` (math rendering), `gh-pages` (deployment)
- ‚úÖ Updated `vite.config.js` with aliases, GitHub Pages base path, build optimization
- ‚úÖ Created directory structure: `src/components/{common,topics,widgets}`, `src/utils`

### 3. Application Architecture Implementation
**Time**: Mid session  
**Action**: Built core application components  
**Details**:
- ‚úÖ Created main `App.vue` with sidebar navigation and component switching
- ‚úÖ Implemented `TopicSidebar.vue` with responsive design (desktop/mobile)
- ‚úÖ Built `MathRenderer.vue` component integrating KaTeX for mathematical notation
- ‚úÖ Component-based navigation (no Vue Router) for simplicity

### 4. Content Structure Development
**Time**: Mid session  
**Action**: Created topic components and mathematical content  
**Details**:
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive `AlgebraContent.vue` with 4 subtopics:
  - Quadratic Functions (with interactive examples)
  - Linear Equations (slope-intercept form)
  - Exponentials & Logarithms (growth patterns)
  - Summation Notation (Œ£ as for-loops analogy)
- ‚úÖ Created placeholder components for all other topics (Basics, Statistics, Trigonometry, Linear Algebra, Calculus)
- ‚úÖ Integrated mathematical examples with proper KaTeX rendering

### 5. Project Documentation
**Time**: Late session  
**Action**: Created comprehensive project documentation  
**Details**:
- ‚úÖ Written `project-outline.md`: Strategic vision, technology rationale, content organization
- ‚úÖ Written `project-blueprint.md`: Complete technical architecture, file structure, component specifications
- ‚úÖ Updated `CLAUDE.md`: Essential guidance for future development
- ‚úÖ Documented learning progression: Basics ‚Üí Algebra ‚Üí Statistics ‚Üí Trigonometry ‚Üí Linear Algebra ‚Üí Calculus

### 6. Deployment Configuration
**Time**: End of session  
**Action**: Fixed GitHub Pages deployment pipeline  
**Details**:
- ‚úÖ Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` based on working VitePress configuration
- ‚úÖ Used modern GitHub Pages deployment method with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Split into build/deploy jobs for reliability
- ‚úÖ Configured for `dist/` output directory

## Technical Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API (modern reactive system)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast development, optimized production builds)
- **Math Rendering**: KaTeX (lightweight, fast LaTeX rendering)
- **Styling**: Native CSS with custom properties (no framework dependencies)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated CI/CD

### Architecture Choices
- **Single-page application**: Component switching instead of routing for simplicity
- **Component-first design**: Each mathematical concept as reusable widget
- **Educational focus**: Math notation connected to programming concepts
- **Progressive complexity**: Structured learning paths across domains

### Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.vue (main shell)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/ (shared: sidebar, math renderer, code fold)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ topics/ (6 main subjects)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/ (interactive components by domain)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/ (math helpers, graphing utilities)
```

## Current Status

### Working Features
- ‚úÖ Development server running at `http://localhost:5173/snake-math-vue/`
- ‚úÖ Responsive sidebar navigation with 6 mathematical topics
- ‚úÖ Interactive algebra section with 4 subtopics and mathematical examples
- ‚úÖ KaTeX integration for beautiful mathematical notation
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design with collapsible sidebar
- ‚úÖ GitHub Pages deployment pipeline ready

### Implementation Progress
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Phase 2 (Core Content)**: üîÑ In Progress (Algebra complete, others need interactive components)
- **Phase 3 (Enhancement)**: ‚è≥ Planned
- **Phase 4 (Optimization)**: ‚è≥ Planned

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Complete Interactive Components** (High Priority)
   - Implement `QuadraticVisualizer.vue` with canvas-based parabola plotting
   - Create `StatisticsCalculator.vue` with descriptive statistics
   - Build `UnitCircleExplorer.vue` for trigonometry

2. **Mathematical Utilities** (High Priority)
   - Implement `mathHelpers.js` with core mathematical functions
   - Create `graphing.js` for canvas visualization utilities
   - Add input validation and error handling

3. **Content Expansion** (Medium Priority)
   - Develop remaining topic content (Statistics, Trigonometry, etc.)
   - Add more interactive examples and programming analogies
   - Create practice problems and exercises

### Technical Improvements
- Add comprehensive error boundaries and loading states
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add export capabilities for visualizations and data
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)

## Notes & Observations

### Strengths of Current Approach
- **Minimal complexity**: No unnecessary dependencies or frameworks
- **Educational focus**: Clear connection between math and programming
- **Maintainable structure**: Consistent patterns and clear organization
- **Fast development**: Vite provides excellent developer experience

### Areas for Future Enhancement
- **PyScript integration**: For in-browser Python code execution
- **Advanced visualizations**: 3D plotting, interactive theorem provers
- **Collaboration features**: Shared mathematical explorations
- **Accessibility improvements**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Key Learnings
- Single-page architecture significantly reduces complexity compared to routing
- KaTeX integration is straightforward and provides excellent mathematical notation
- Component-based design naturally organizes mathematical concepts
- Responsive design requires careful consideration of mathematical visualizations

## Session Summary
Successfully migrated from VitePress concept to working Vue 3 + Vite application with foundational structure, core navigation, comprehensive algebra content, and deployment pipeline. Project is ready for expansion of interactive mathematical components and content development.
